# Summary

HyperCoast is a Python package designed to provide an accessible and comprehensive set of tools for visualizing and analyzing hyperspectral data in coastal regions. Building on the capabilities of popular packages like Leafmap [@Wu2021] and PyVista [@Sullivan2019], HyperCoast streamlines the process of exploring and interpreting complex remote sensing data. This enables researchers and environmental managers to gain deeper insights into the dynamic processes occurring in coastal environments [@Liu2021; @Liu2023].

HyperCoast supports the reading and visualization of hyperspectral data from various NASA airborne and satellite missions, such as AVIRIS [@Green1998], NEON [@Kampe2010], PACE [@Gorman2019], and EMIT [@Green2021], along with other datasets like DESIS [@Alonso2019] and ECOSTRESS [@Fisher2020]. Users can interactively explore hyperspectral data, extract spectral signatures, change band combinations and colormaps, visualize data in 3D, and perform interactive slicing and thresholding operations. Additionally, leveraging the earthaccess [@barrett2024] package, HyperCoast offers tools for searching NASA hyperspectral data interactively. This makes it a versatile and powerful tool for working with hyperspectral data globally, with a particular focus on coastal regions.
